This is the AwesomeScript translator.

AwesomeScript is designed to convert awesomescript code (see example,
it's very similar to javascript) into fully parsable php code.
This achieves the effect of a sandbox when the code is compiling,
while not being in one at the same time.

This scripting language is created to let people add own scripts into
working pages without the system to worry about invalid calls.
